            Chow Mo-wan: That handbag I saw you with this evening... Where did you buy it? Su Li-zhen: Why do you ask?
            Chow Mo-wan: It looked so elegant. I want to get one for my wife. Su Li-zhen: Mr. Chow, you're so good to
            your wife! Chow Mo-wan: Not really! My wife is so fussy. Her birthday is some days away. I don't know what
            to get her. Could you buy one for me to give her? Su Li-zhen: Maybe she wouldn't want one just exactly the
            same. Chow Mo-wan: You're right, I didn't think of that. Su Li-zhen: A woman would mind. Chow Mo-wan: Yes,
            especially since we're neighbors. Do they come in other colors? Su Li-zhen: I'd have to ask my husband. Chow
            Mo-wan: Why? Su Li-zhen: He bought it for me on a business trip abroad. They aren't on sale here. Chow
            Mo-wan: Then never mind. Su Li-zhen: Actually... I want to ask you something too. Where did you buy your
            tie? Chow Mo-wan: I don't know where it came from. My wife buys all my ties. Su Li-zhen: Really? Chow
            Mo-wan: She bought this one on a business trip abroad. It's not on sale here. Su Li-zhen: What a
            coincidence! Chow Mo-wan: Yes. Su Li-zhen: Actually... My husband has one just like it. He said it was a
            gift from his boss. So he wears it every day. Chow Mo-wan: And my wife has a bag just like yours. Su
            Li-zhen: I know, I've seen it. Chow Mo-wan: What are you getting at, actually? Su Li-zhen: I thought I was
            the only one who knew.
